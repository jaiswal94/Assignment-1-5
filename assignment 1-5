The differences between Data and Big data  are:-
Data-Symbols or signals that are input, stored, and processed by a computer, for output as usable information.
Bigdata-voluminous amount of structured, semistructured and unstructured data that has the potential to be mined for information.
                                              or
Big Data is a high-volume, highvelocity,and high-variety information asset thatdemands cost-effective, innovative forms of information
processing for enhanced insight and decision making.

Main reasons behind hadoop becoming the solution for Data explosion are:-
The reason that Hadoop is such a great solution is that it's inexpensive, scalable and completely flexible. 
You don't need to predict, in advance, what kinds of data you'll capture and store.
The system is able to handle any format, including new formats as they emerge. 
That's crucial, since we can't predict today what sensors, what systems and what data formats we'll be using five or 10 years hence.Hadoop is, by a considerable margin, the most successful platform for big data storage and processing in the world
